# Data-Mining-without-using-pre-defined-library-functions
Data mining algorithms like apriori, decision tree, Naive bayes classifier etc without using their pre defined library functions.

The decision tree using ID3 is genrealized. While using some other dataset, just put the name of the column containing the labels in the dataset into the variable 'labels.'
